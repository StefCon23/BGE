I plan to make a model of a seagull that walks on its legs.
The connection between the neck and the body will be a ball and socket joint.
The legs will be hinge joints that move forwards and backwards.
The powersource will be in each of the seagulls feet.

This is a simplified model of what I hope to accomplish.
